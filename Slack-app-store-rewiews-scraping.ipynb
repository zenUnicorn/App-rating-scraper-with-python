       "  'review': 'The recent iPad App update misses the mark quite considerably. In some ways, it is almost as if Slack doesn’t understand its users. No longer easy to see all unread messages in one place - which was a feature I regularly requested for the desktop app. Now, the iPad app has been turned to be quite bland. Seems like the “Dark Mode” folks won the design argument; as the new app no longer supports the desktop or web app color themes; which now makes the iPad app incredibly difficult to know at a glance which team you’re viewing. Also frustrating are the 3 or so “Unread Direct Messages” you can see, when you tap “Show All” it takes you to the “Direct Messages” sidebar that sorts in its own way, with unreads strewn about. Also, Direct message addresses are much harder to read; too much text all clumped together. Unfortunate for the iPad app, Slack has taken a once very useful version (preferred as a second screen in some cases over the desktop app) and made it into a giant iPhone app. The iPhone app now also suffers from this Direct Message unread messages “Show All” problem. The only way to return some of the missing sort and see all DMs on the iPad app is to select the sort option of “by recent” but it does not group unreads. 7 years using Slack, and this is by far the most disappointing iPad app “upgrade.” Repackage the desktop app for the iPad and call it “Slack Pro” for iPad Pro users who use their iPad in place of a laptop.',\n",

The ability to control editing window behavior is gone. Hardware keyboard integration is worse, with shortcut keys being removed. It\\'s become riddled with bugs. Just scrolling the chat will randomly throw one of your messages into edit mode if you touch it wrong. Every couple of versions it stops accepting Return to send when using a hardware keyboard.

I’ve also noticed in those past five years, Slack has barely innovated and as of recently, especially during 2020 when most applications like zoom, Google meet, and Microsoft teams have been booming with innovation in new ways of interacting in this new work from home work life. Now with the acquisition from salesforce, I truly feel like Slack is going to go down the drain and what was once the industry leader in communication has sat back on the couch, slacking, watching everybody else move forward. As of today, we are looking into other platforms outside of Slack due to the lack of innovation and buy out from sales force. An example of what I think is easy innovative feedback, we’ve been asking for voice clips to send both privately and in channels up to 2 to 5 minutes long so managers can leave a status update or important message or daily briefing first thing in the morning without having to type it all out and can do it on the go; nothing.

I have to go dismiss them all one at a time even though the app should know I’ve read them.

However, recent updates changed the behavior of unread messages in a way that makes it extremely aggravating to use. Until recently, I could go to my Home view and see all unread messages grouped together at the top. This was so wonderful and intuitive! Now I only see 3 unread messages with a link to show the rest. Unfortunately, when you tap the link to “show all x” it takes you to the DMs screen where messages are in chronological order. This means my unread messages are scattered all over the place, and as a result I no longer have a way to just see all my unread messages grouped together. Either bring back the original view that was there FOREVER, have the “show all x” link expand to see them all from Home, or allow me to group unread messages at the top of the DMs page.

The big thing is that after the do not disturb period ends, you don’t get notified of the messages that you received within that time period. So many people end up not seeing those messages until much later, or not at all. I think slack should notify you immediately after the do not disturb period ends so you can respond to those messages in a timely fashion. This seems like a big thing to overlook.',\n",

If you don’t wanna spend money on video/voice chat or Spence money getting extra storage of messages, just use discord. It’s basically the same thing with a few slight differences like direct responses to a single text but like each text is a post and the replies could be comments on that message, for example.
